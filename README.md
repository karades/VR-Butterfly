# VR-Butterfly
Project from my engineer thesis in VR

The scope of the thesis is to implement an application in virtual reality to set a person in virtual place, where he will be able to productively confront his fear of butterflies in safe environment. The application should be available and executable for every user who has application and virtual reality glasses
